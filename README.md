This repo also contains jupyter notebooks that were used for exploratory analysis and data ingestion.  Admittedly, these notebooks are not well organized.

This app is designed to help dispensary owners better understand their performance over time and in relation to other dispensaries within the same city and the entire state.  Refer to the website for further information.
